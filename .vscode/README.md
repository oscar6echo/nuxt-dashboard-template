### Keyboard Shortcuts

They cannot be set by workspace.  
So they must be configured manually.

To set a shortcut for eslint/fix (which in general has a different effect from the standard `Format Document` command):

- Open keyboard shortcut from `Ctrl+Shift+P`
- Type `Open Keyboard Shortcuts`
- Search for `eslint.executeAutofix``
- `Record Keys` (button in omni-box)
- Set the shortcut to `Shift+Alt+G`(for instance)
